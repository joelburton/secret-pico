Yay!

`ðŸŽ‰`:emoji-5x:

You did it! Congrats on making through this adventure!

I hope you had some challenge, some fun, and learned some new things.

In the envelope is a temporary tattoo with Blinka, the mascot for Python on
Microcontrollers. Wear her with pride. (And if you do, take a picture and send
me! I want to see!)

There are three parts you haven't yet read:

- `Experimenting <./experimenting.html>`_: What else is in that envelope? Where 
  can I learn more?

- `Wiring <./wiring.html>`_: What are all the connections on the board you gave
  us? How can I fix this if a wire comes loose?

- `Source Code <./source.html>`_
