Micropython
===========

The Pico can be programmed in different languages; it's been very common for
people to program microcontrollers in very low-level languages, like assembly
or C. Primarily, this was because microcontrollers have very limited memory
and relatively slow CPUs [please don't tell Pico this!].

However, as microcontrollers have become more powerful, it's becoming possible
to program these in higher-level languages. Given Python's deep usage in math
and science, Python is particularly popular here.

All of the software Joel wrote for you (except for a very, very tiny part in
assembly, to show you rainbows) was written in `Micropython
<https://micropython.org>`_, a version of Python 3 that can with very limited
memory and good performance.

Of course, Python isn't the only language for computers like these: Joel
gave Elie a present of a tiny microcontroller that can be programmed in
`JavaScript <https://www.espruino.com/>`_.
