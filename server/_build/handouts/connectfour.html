<p>Connect Four is an interesting game — while it is marketed as a kids’ game,
it has been studied in game theory and computer science because it is a good
platform for experimenting with computer AIs.</p>
<p>It is a “solved game”; researchers have discovered the <em>perfect play</em> for it —
a mapping of an exact sequence that will win against the best possible defense.
You may find <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDWPi1pZ0Po">this short video</a>
very interesting.</p>
<p>The AI for your Pico’s connect four game is written in Python and uses a common
AI algorithm called <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">Minimax</a>; many
game AIs use this as their foundation. In particular, the AI also uses a
technique called <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha–beta_pruning">Alpha-Beta pruning</a> to avoid exploring paths
that cannot be possible better/worse than paths already seen.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of writing this AI is that the Pico has relatively limited
memory compared to a real computer — only about 128 kilobytes are available
for a Python program — and the minimax algorithm relies on deep recursion
and making new copies of the game board at every step. Therefore, the code for
the AI is well-optimized for performance and minimal memory usage (at the
expense of some code clarity; the AI functions are overly long and not broken
down, to minimize adding things to the call stack).</p>
<p>Once you’re done with everything, I’ll show you the code for everything here.</p>
