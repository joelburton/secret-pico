<p>Want to learn more?</p>
<p>In that bag, I’ve included some other electronic components you can
use with your Pico:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Five LEDs, in <span class="red">red</span>, <span class="blue">blue</span>, <span class="gold">yellow</span>, <span class="green">green</span>, and <span class="inv-gray">white</span>.</p>
<p>Quite sensibly, Sterling got five additional clear LEDs, all of which provide
blue light. I think perhaps they like blue.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Five 220Ω (“ohm”) resistors (the tiny things with long wires sticking out of
both ends; the LEDs need something to resist the voltage of the Pico down to
the voltage the LEDs want)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A motion detector (the globe on the green circuit board).</p>
<p>Since Winnie was so good-humored about my making her the evil character in our
security stories, I included a second motion detector for her, so she can be
alerted if people try to sneak up in different directions.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Wires with different kinds of ends (to use them separately, just peel them
apart)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A few spare buttons (<em>momentary switches</em>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<img alt="_images/book.png" src="_images/book.png" style="width: 20em;" />
<p>These things, plus the stuff already on the breadboard, happen to be <em>exactly</em>
the components required by the very excellent book
<a class="reference external" href="https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/books/micropython-pico/pdf/download">Get Started with MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico</a>.
This book walks through some fundamental concepts about programming hardware,
and has several projects using these components.</p>
<p>The artwork makes this book look like it’s only for kids, but it has a lot of
useful stuff in it for any programmer.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>I included a different display</p>
<p>In Chapter 10 of this book, they show you how to program a SerLCD 16x2 LCD
display. I considered using one of those but they’re heavy, expensive, use
a fair amount of power, and are pretty much technology from the 1980s. Instead,
the display on your Pico is a tiny OLED (organic LED) display. These are a
very new and interesting technology; they use considerably less power than
traditional LCD displays and are brighter.</p>
<p class="last">The model I’ve included for you is a SSD1306 128x64 OLED display; it uses
the i2c protocol described in the book, but not the SPI protocol, so you can
still go through that chapter for the i2c parts.</p>
